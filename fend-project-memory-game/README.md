# Memory Game Project

## My memory game project for Grow with Google

### Commonly known as *Concentration* or *Pairs*

You must turn over cards and match a pair!

To start, click on your first card and it will turn over, once you click a 2nd card it will count as a "move". If you match 2 cards, they will stay turned face up.

You win when all cards are face up. 

You will be scored using a star system which is based on moves, lower the move count, higher the score. 3 stars is the highest you can achieve and it means you earned a perfect score.
